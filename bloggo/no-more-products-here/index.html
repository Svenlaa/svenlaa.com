<h1>No more products on here</h1>
<p>
    Quite a few Bloggo posts have been about products. Specific products sold by huge companies. Enough of that. I think
    "Sony in Pink" is the worst post on the Bloggo by far. It's an ad with a gimmick forced in. I do not like it. I
    don't want to define myself by the products I use.
</p>
<p>
    Products are easy to write about. A lot of the story is written for you. That story is called an
    <i>advertisement</i>. I block as much of those as I can. I don't want the Bloggo to be full of them.
</p>
<p>
    That doesn't mean there will be no more products on here. But the products can't be the focus. A Bloggo post
    shouldn't be an advert. It should be personal to me. <a href="/bloggo/water-bottle">Water Bottle</a> is good.
</p>
<p>
    I think consumerism is bad. It's a distraction from life. It's often used to ignore life. I want to be around
    people, build connections and enjoy the little things. Those are worth sharing.
