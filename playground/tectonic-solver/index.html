<h1>Tectonic Solver</h1>
<p>
    Tectonic, also known as <a href="https://www.solitaireparadise.com/games_list/suguru.html">Suguru</a>, is a puzzle game. This is an attempt at a solver. You can not play this. If it's
    solved, all cells will be filled in! This can now solve some easier puzzles, but as you can see, it doesn't work for harder ones yet.
