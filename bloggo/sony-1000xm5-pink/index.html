<h1>Sony in Pink</h1>
<p>
    Sony has just announced "smoky pink" versions of their flagship earbuds (WF-1000XM5) and headphones (WH-1000XM5).
    It's an understated pink. It looks quite gray. The advert has members of the KPOP Girl Group
    <i>Le Sserafim</i> wearing them. They launch on the 30th of September 2024. They're available for preorder. I enjoy
    the music of the KPOP group.

    Notably, a marketing video for the headphones on the Dutch retailer
    <a
        href="https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/sony-wh-1000xm5-draadloze-koptelefoon-met-noise-cancelling-roze/9300000187649792"
        style="--color: var(--purple)"
        >bol.com</a
    >
    claims the headphones are <i>the best earbuds with noise cancelling</i>. That's the wrong product category. I sent
    them an email. They asked for details. I responded with details. Sony haven't responded yet.
