<h1>I like warm lights</h1>
<p>
    When I moved house, I looked on pinterest for ideas on how the inside should look. Some pictures felt nicer to be
    in. I wondered why. It turns out it's the color temperature of the lights. You don't want it to be the color of
    broad daylight when the sun is down. You want it to be as orange as a fire.
</p>
<p>
    I really like them. You don't notice them during the day. They are off. They really shine during the night. I got
    the warmest lights I could easily find. I ended up with 2000K bulbs from the hardware store. I really like them. It
    feels like a night perfect at light. My big kitchen light that was installed when I moved in is way brighter. It's
    less comfortable to be in too. I often leave it off.
</p>

    There has been a drawback. Because the lights aren't white, colors are different. It looks very weird in pictures.
    Especially with yellow. The yellow and white on my rubiks cube look very similar. It makes it hard to solve
    sometimes. Book pages are also a bit yellowed, but that's perfectly fine.
