<h1>Water Bottle</h1>
<p>
    I use the same water bottle brand for long stretches of time. I used to rely on disposable bottles. Now it's a â‚¬7
    reusable non-insulated stainless steel one that contains up to 700ml. I've been using that one bottle for 11 months
    now. The dark gray paint is slowly falling off. Patches of steel are showing.
</p>
<p>
    I've gone through several types. It started out with any bottle we had at home. Usually Vitamin Water. I realised I
    can't drink from bottles with narrow openings. The end of those 1.5L soda bottles is just too small. It's a mess.
    After I realised this I went with Lipton Ice Tea Peach 500ml bottles, with a distinctive orange cap. I used this
    type for a while, but prices increased. I went looking for a new one. I found a 750ml Solan De Cabras bottle. I used
    this one for a while too. Those were all disposable and made from plastic. That's horrible for the environment and
    my wallet. The material for my new bottle would be steel. I can drop it and it's not plastic. I liked the size of my
    Solan De Cabras bottle. I bought one at a local store after I gave it a test walk in my coats inner pocket.
</p>
<p>
    Having the same bottle gives me comfort. I always have something to drink. It's always water. It's always the same
    bottle. It's predictable and I like that. If my world changed tomorrow, I'd still have my familiar water bottle with
    me. It makes new places and people less scary.
