<h1>Android apps I love</h1>
<p>
    Here's a collection of Android apps I love. Most of them will have a specific usecase. If it's a general app, I'll
    explain why it's better than the alternatives.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher"
        >Niagara Launcher</a
    >
    is a home screen with a twist. Usually you have icons in a grid on a home screen. Niagara has a long list. Your home
    screen is a smaller list with your favorite apps, clock and maybe a widget. Notifications show up in the app list.
    It's very easy to handle with one hand. Scroll with the alphabet scrollbar, tap your app.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.android">Beeper</a>
    is a chat aggregator. It shows your conversations from a lot of apps in one. SMS, RCS, WhatsApp, Twitter, Discord,
    LinkedIn and a few more. It's nice to only have to check one app.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet"
        >Wavelet</a
    >
    is an audio equaliser (EQ). It adjusts your headphones' sound to make it more balanced. Are your Sony earbuds too
    bass-heavy? Wavelet has a profile for your earbuds, so they sound more neutral.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp"
        >KDE Connect</a
    >
    is the best way to connect your phone to your PC. I am using it with Windows and Linux (Gnome). It can sync
    notifications, clipboard music and more. I find it works better than Link to PC on Windows. You have to install the
    KDE Connect program on your PC too.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm"
        >Tasker</a
    >
    is a paid tool for automation. I vaguely know it's similar to Apple Shortcuts. I am using it to turn on Do Not
    Disturb while at work and turn it off when I leave. Before I automated this, my phone would often stay silent.
    Tasker can be a lot more powerful than my use case.
</p>
<p>
    <a style="--color: var(--purple)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">OsmAnd</a> is a
    navigation app. It's similar to Google Maps. OsmAnd the app for Open Street Maps. Open Street Maps has a lot more
    data, especially for footpaths and small bike routes. It has information on traffic lights, benches and speedbumps.
    It also has a great offline mode. When I started using OsmAnd, Google Maps didn't have any offline directions.
