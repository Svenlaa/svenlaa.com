    It has a focus on Albums. You add an Album to your library, your collection. Spotify often releases a single, then
    an album. On Apple Music you get one song of the album. When the whole album unlocks, you can listen to everything.

    Microsoft Store. On Linux you'll have to settle for a web version. You can also use
