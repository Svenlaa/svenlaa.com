<h1>Sunday walks</h1>
<p>
    On Sunday mornings I often go on a walk with my mom and the dog. My mom picks me up and we drive to a nice hilly forest. We get coffee from a
    thermos in the car. We talk about things from the previous week. I appreciate those walks and talks. It gets me out of the house and gets me
    moving. I love seeing the seasons change.
