<h1>I'm here now</h1>
<p>
    Thanks to lovely people on the internet I'm here now. I'd like to give some credit to
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com">Lu from TodePond</a>, because of <span data-roller="them, her, him">them</span> I
    joined Mastodon and met great people there. I took a lot of parts from todepond dot com. This starts as a copy.

    I don't know what will be on the Bloggo. But I want to write every day. Please check back often. It might change
    while you are not looking.
