<h1>Don't get the product to get into the thing</h1>
<p>
    no products needed to do the thing. you won't do the thing just because you get product. you probably don't want to
    do the thing if you don't do it until you get product. you might think about the thing "it'd be nice if i could do
    it". that does not mean you want to do it. if you want to do it you will find a way to do it with the things you
    have right now.

<ul>
    <li>a better rubiks cube won't get you into cubing again. <br />you get back into cubing by doing it.</li>
    <li>better running shoes won't get you back into running. <br />you get back into running by running.</li>
    <li>
        a better piano/keyboard won't get you to play the piano. <br />you get into the piano by playing the damn piano.
    </li>
    <li>
        a better computer won't get you into coding. <br />
        coding will.
    </li>
    <li>a new videogame won't get you back into videogames <br />playing the videogames you have will.</li>
    <li>
        a new videogame <b>might</b> get you into that one videogame. <br />there's a difference between
        <i>a videogame</i> and <i>videogames</i>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are exceptions. If you want to get into tennis, you have to get the racket, the ball and the field. You can
    rent them. See if you're into it after three months. If you are, commit to the bit.
