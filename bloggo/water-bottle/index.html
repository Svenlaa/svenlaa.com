<h1>Water Bottle</h1>
<p>
    I use the same water bottle brand for long streches of time. It used to be a lot of the same disposable bottles. Now
    it's a reusable non-insulated stainless steel one that contains up to 700ml. I've been using that one bottle for 11
    months now. The dark gray paint is slowly falling off. Patches of steel are showing.
</p>
<p>
    I've gone through several types. It started out with any bottle we had at home. Usually Vitamin Water. Once I didn't
    use those bottles I realised I can't drink from bottles with a small end. The end of those 1.5L soda bottles is just
    too small. It's a mess. After I realised this I went with Lipton Ice Tea Peach 500ml bottles, with a distinctive
    orange cap. I used this type for a while, but prices increased. I went looking for a new one. I found a 750ml Solan
    De Cabras bottle. I used this one for a while too. Those were all disposable and made from plastic.,That's horrible
    for the environment and my wallet. The material for my new bottle would be steel. I can drop it and it's not
    plastic. I liked the size of my Solan De Cabras bottle. I bought one at a local store after I gave it a test walk in
    my coats inner pocket.

    Having the same bottle gives me comfort. I always have something to drink. It's always water. It's always the same
    bottle. It's predictable and I like that. If my world changed tomorrow, I'd still have my familiar water bottle with
    me. It makes new places and people less scary.
