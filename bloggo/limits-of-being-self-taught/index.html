<h1>Limits of being self-taught</h1>
<p>
    I am noticing things about me that show I don't have any formal education like my colleagues. This can work in my
    favour. I have more practical experience, my coworkers get surprised by my knowledge of the browser devtools.
</p>
<p>
    We're exploring more fields and patterns, and I don't have experience in any of it. My breath of knowledge is small.
    I'm decent at fields I'm "specialized" in, but barely know anything beyond that. I don't even know where to start.
    If you have a starting point, it's easier to branch out and grow.
