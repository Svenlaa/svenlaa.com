<h1>It'll be funny</h1>
<p>Do it anyway, it'll be funny.</p>
<p>
    Taking risks is hard. I love consistency, I love knowing what comes next. It's especially hard for me to take the
    small risks. Through the years I came along little things can make it easier to take them. My most helpful one is
    asking- talking about your problems with people who support and encourage you. Doing this is still hard. You still
    feel like you are taking a risk, only a different one. You also need to have people next to you that support you. I
    often don't have this.
</p>
<p>
    This next one is easier. It's always there. If the risk feel too big you can say/think "is grappig" which means
    "It'll be funny". It's not important. It doesn't matter. It'll be funny.
