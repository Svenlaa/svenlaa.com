<h1>A bad Outlook</h1>
<p>I tried using outlook on my phone to write a Bloggo post. It didn't go well.</p>
<p>
    Email is a useful tool. You can use it to send text between devices. Write on your phone in the notes app. Copy it.
    Paste it into the email client. Send it and touch it up on your PC. Why is there a step to copy and paste? I can
    write in my email client. It even has formatting!
</p>
<p>
    While writing email on laptop I noticed that outlook automatically saves drafts of emails you are writing. I often
    had to clear out drafts that merely contained my email signature. Awesome, a feature to save posts I'm working on.
    It turns out outlook mobile only saves when you exit the writing screen, by the back gesture for example.
</p>
<p>
    For some reason you can convert your email to a calendar event with one tap in outlook. You can't convert back. You
    can <b>try</b> to discard the calendar event and rely on outlook saving drafts.
</p>
<p>You didn't exit the writing screen with the back gesture. You entered a new screen. The draft wasn't saved.</p>
<p>Water Bottle coming tomorrow :)</p>
