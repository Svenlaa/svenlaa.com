    It has a focus on Albums. You add an Album to your library, your collection. Spotify often releases a single, then
    an album. On Apple Music you get one song of the album. When the whole album unlocks, you can listen to everything.

    interesting Apple is willing to pay the 15% subscription fee to Google. It might help with their legal battle
    against Spotify.

    It's not reliable at all.

    Microsoft Store. On Linux you'll have to settle for a web version. You can also use
