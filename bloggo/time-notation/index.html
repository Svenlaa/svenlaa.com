<p>The time is currently <b id="time-local">14:19</b>, which can also be written as <b id="time-local-ao">A439</b>.</p>
<p>
    Let's assume you've been awake since
    <input type="time" value="07:00" name="waketime" id="input_waketime" aria-label="Wake Time" />
</p>
<p>
    That means you've been awake for <b><span id="awake-minutes">439</span> minutes</b>
</p>
<p>
    You only reach a 1000 minutes after being awake for 16 hours and 40 minutes, leaving 7 hours and 20 minutes for
    sleep. That means most people are awake for around 1000 minutes a day.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, the amount of minutes you've been awake is a good estimate of how much percent (promille) of the day
    you've spent.
</p>
<p>Time is the most important resource we have, and it's therefore useful to be aware of how much we're spending.</p>

<h2>Dividing time</h2>
<p>
    Time is not divided using maths and units and calculations. The divisions in time are mostly ways of combining time
    with language. Because of this, there are lots and lots and lots of systems, with subtle differences and mostly used
    interchangably. The world is complicated.
</p>
<p>There are four major ways of defining time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Based on the duration it takes for earth to rotate on it's axis - day</li>
    <li>
        Based on the duration the sun is visible from earth - daytime (approximately half a day, varies throughout year)
    </li>
    <li>Based on the duration it takes for moon to rotate around earth - month</li>
    <li>Based on the duration it takes for earth to rotate around sun - year</li>
    <li>Based on the duration of oscillations of cesium atom microwave radiation - second, building block</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the units using the building block defined way</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>second</strong>,
        <a href="https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/second-introduction">according to NIST</a>, is currently defined
        using cesium atoms, which absorb and emit microwave radiation with a specific frequency. Atomic clocks count
        9,192,631,770 of those microwave oscillations, and we call the elapsed time interval a second.
    </li>
    <li><strong>minute</strong> consists of <strong>60 second</strong></li>
    <li><strong>hour</strong> consists of <strong>60 minute</strong> (3600 second)</li>
    <li><strong>day</strong> consists of <strong>24 hour</strong> (1440 minute, 86400 second)</li>
    <li><strong>week</strong> consists of <strong>7 day</strong> (168 hour, 10080 minute, 604800 second)</li>
</ul>

<h2>A different system</h2>

<p>Let's define a system that's based on my schedule.</p>
<p>I live in the industrialized world. I have an office job with a consistent schedule. I value routine.</p>
<p>My routine revolves around the day. It revolves around the time I am awake and the time I am asleep.</p>
<p>
    It'd be nice if the new system can be integrated with the current one. It should be relatively easy to switch
    between the two. One should be able to mentally convert the systems with less than a month of practice.
</p>
<p>
    One is awake for around 1000 minutes, which is a nice round number that integrates with the current system. The
    existing units can be integrated.
</p>
<p>
    The epoch of the day is oddly defined. It's based on "midnight" which is around an eigth into my sleep. It's based
    on midday, the time when the sun is the highest in the sky. But that definition got muddled over the last few
    centuries. It's at the highest point in the sky 1h30 minutes AFTER noon. The epoch's off by ONE AND A HALF HOURS.
    Partially to make bisnis easier. Partially for a more united Europe. Partially because of historical energy needs.
    Partially because people think "summer time" is nice because it's WARMER because the name has SUMMER IN IT. (i am
    getting annoyed)
</p>
<p>
    Where was I? Oh I see, we can redifine the epoch. It's arbitrarly defined, with a definition that has become less
    useful over time.
</p>
<p>
    Let's define the epoch at when I wake up. The day starts when I start. That has the nice bonus of time hitting 1000
    minutes when I go to bed. I can do that because it's a system defined for me and me alone.
</p>
<p>To make that a possibility, one should primarily use the minute unit. We'll ditch the hour to accomplish this.</p>
<p>
    Now, what about nighttime? We could either keep counting from 1000 to 1439, or we could switch to an AM/PM like
    system. Use vowels because they're distinct. A for Awake, O for overnight.
</p>
<p>
    Now, we could make the O-range from 000 to 439 or from 000 to 999, changing the definition of a minute. We'll stick
    with the minute-defined time. We wouldn't want to change our fundamental unit. Keeping the minute inline also allows
    us to convert. Although I wish you the best of luck doing that a O140 (3AM)
</p>

<h2>A/O Time Notation</h2>
<p>
    A/O starts the time when I wake up, 7AM. It is A000 (Oh Zero). You usually don't have to pronounce A, just like you
    don't say AM. It's obvious from context. Notation should always include A/O. 10 minutes later I'm up at A010 (Oh
    Ten). At A330 (Three Thirty) (12:30 PM) it's time for lunch. It's time to go to bed at A950 (10:50PM). I sleep well
    and don't see the O-range.
</p>
<p>
    We have a system that keeps track of your percentage (promille) of your waking duration spent. It starts when you
    wake up and stops when you go to bed. Time keeps going on while you're asleep, but you don't notice. Sleep is a time
    machine to breakfast.
