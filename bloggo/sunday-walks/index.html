<h1>Sunday walks</h1>
<p>
    On Sunday mornings I often go on a walk with my mom and the dog. My mom picks me up and we drive to a nice hilly
    forest. We get coffee from a thermos in the car. We talk about things from the previous week. I appreciate those
    walks and talks. It gets me out of the house and gets me moving. I love seeing the seasons change.
