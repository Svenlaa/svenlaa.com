<h1>Language Learning</h1>
<p>
    The best way to learn is a language is by listening to it a lot, get a lot of input. You shouldn't understand it
    yet. Avoid subtitles. It's tedious. I didn't think I was making progress. Little by little you understand words,
    phrases, sentences and conversations.
</p>
<p>Don't use a textbook or course as the main way to learn. You may only use them in ADDITION to listening.</p>
<p>
    I am a native Dutch speaker. I've learned English. I don't know all of English grammar rules. Most of them are
    learned by seeing and hearing a ton of it. The brain will figure out patterns, that's what it's good at.
</p>
<p>
    Dutch and English are very closely related. Both are Germanic languages with a touch of Romance language added. It's
    relatively easy.
</p>
<p>
    After struggling with Japanese, I'm using this input method. I can't understand what these podcasts are talking
    about. I need to think too much about the grammar. It's not intuitive yet. I need to listen more. I need more input.
