<h1>I dislike ebooks</h1>
<p>I don't dislike ebooks. I dislike the <b>business model</b> behind ebooks.</p>
<p>
    I like books. They're a source of entertainment. It's relaxing to read a book. If you have a good one, it can pull
    you in better than a TV show or movie could. Ebooks are the new thing being pushed by huge companies. They're
    cheaper to make. Stores are owned by one company. That company has total control. The big two are Kindle by Amazon
    and Kobo by Rakuten. They make devices. The company wants you to use their store on the device. It's the easiest. I
    have a problem with these stores. The devices are fine. You can load your own ebooks on them. But you can't get
    ebooks easily from things other than the big two.
</p>
<p>
    Ebooks can be great. They're incredibly small, often less than 1 MB. They have very little infra cost. Transport is
    cheap. Storage is even cheaper. They weigh less and they don't take up physical space. It's less bad for the
    environment. However, Global Warming can only be solved through regulation and collective action.

    The stores don't allow you to share ebooks. You can't sell them. You can't lend them out. You can't buy them
    second-hand. You can't read them the way you want. You don't own them. You own a license. If Kobo or Kindle ever
    shut down, you can lose all your ebooks.
</p>
<p>
    Somehow they're only $2 to $3 cheaper than regular books. You would think that less costs for the comapnies would
    result in books that are much cheaper. It can easily cost $3 to print a 200 page paperback book. That doesn't
    include shipping. That doesn't include storage. That doesn't include the cost of the bookstore. Digital is so much
    cheaper, but you're not getting that benefit.
</p>
<p>
    This problem isn't unique to ebooks. Digital games have the same problem. Subscription "services" have a similar
    problem. I don't like it. It won't be solved. The people with power like to grow their power.
