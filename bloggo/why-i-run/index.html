<h1>Why I run</h1>
<p>
    It's hard to say exactly why I started. It might've been the ASML sponsored marathon. I enjoyed walking, I wanted to
    go faster. Moving is great for mental health, which I struggle with. In reality it's a combination of all these
    things and more that I don't know.
</p>
<p>
    Shortly before I started, I got stopped by the cops. It was dark and I wanted to get home fast. I got stopped
    because I ran away from the town centre, away from the shops. I also got tired very quickly. I wanted to be active.
    You don't need a lot to start running. I started in long jeans, a shirt and my regular shoes. I quickly changed into
    my PE shoes. That made it more comfortable. I didn't want to get new gear. I often tend to buy gear, only for me to
    use to it a few times.
</p>
<p>
    I followed the 5K program from Samsung Health. It's free and easy to find. I wanted a fitness tracker to measure
    heart-rate. A cheap one. I could use it beside running too. It wouldn't be too much of a waste if I stopped. I could
    get it if I followed the progam consistently for 2 weeks. I bought a Galaxy Fit 2 for â‚¬40. That's in part how
    Samsung can offer the program for free.
</p>
<p>
    Running shoes make it easier to run. Their big cushion makes you get more energy back from every step. They also
    reduce the chance of injury. A great thing to have. I had to think of a new goal and I had 10 weeks left in the
    program. If I ran 5K, I couldn't get some good shoes. I started running with someone besides the Samsung Program. I
    reached my goal in 10 weeks.
</p>
<p>
    Now I wanted to set my sights on something bigger. The marathon in Eindhoven sponsored by ASML. I didn't reach it.
    The goal felt impossible to reach. I didn't have the guidance of a Program anymore. I felt bad if I ran again after
    a 2 week break. "Look how long that break was, you can't do it" I thought. The Eindhoven marathon date approached
    quickly and I wasn't ready at all. I hadn't even run 10K, far from the 42K of a marathon. I didn't run it.
</p>
<p>
    The Enschede half-marathon was 6 months in the future. It was on the same date as my little sisters birthday. I
    didn't want to miss my sisters birthday if it was important to her. I sent a message in the family group chat asking
    if I could run it. They encouraged me to do it. I started running more often again. I thought differently. Instead
    of focusing on the 2 week long break, I thought about the accomplishment. From "You took a 2 week break,
    <i>you shouldn't do that</i>", to "I accomplished infintely more than if I didn't run, because
    <i>I did run today</i>. Great job". When I went to my parents' house, I asked them to pick me up so I could run the
    5K back. I was encouraged by everyone I knew. That was something I hadn't felt for nearly a decade. I finished the
    half-marathon in 1 hour and 58 minutes, 15 minutes faster than I had thought when I started running it.
</p>
<p>
    The moment I finished the half-marathon my goal was completed. I stopped running. "I am staying active by cycling to
    work". Months later I wanted to run again, and I made myself a new goal. One short-term goal so I would stay
    motivated. One very long-term goal so I wouldn't stop. My new short-term goal is to run a 5K in 25 minutes, at 5
    minutes per km, or 12km/h. My very long-term goal is to run an ultramarathon. Because this is very long-term, I
    don't have specifics. I am thinking of about 80K, or 50 miles. I also have a few intermediate goals for when I
    finish my short term goal. I tried to order them, but it might change if something's available earlier and I feel up
    to it.
